        In its pure form, espresso is more popular in Europe than America, particularly in Italy.
        Though catching in America, derivatives and misconceptions are spreading like cream in coffee.
        For instance, many hold the misconception that espresso is a dark, bitter to burnt-flavored roast of coffee.
        In fact, espresso is not a roast at all; it is a method of preparing coffee. Espresso coffee is often blended from several roasts and varietals to
        form a bold - not bitter flavor. The finely ground coffee is tightly packed or tamped into a “portafilter”; high-pressure water is then forced through
        the grounds and extracted in small, concentrated amounts. Intensity is the key here.

         A ‘traditional morning heart starter’. Steamed foamed velvety milk poured over one shot (1) of coffee oil extract made from 12gm of freshly ground
        beans producing 38ml of essence.Finished by topping with foam and a sprinkle of chocolate powder. Served in a pre heated vitrified ceramic cup.
        A cappuccino usually exceeds the height of the cup, making the foam visible above the side of the cup.
        The foam on top of the cappuccino acts as an insulator and helps retain the heat of the liquid, allowing it to stay hotter longer."

An Americano is an espresso-based drink designed to resemble coffee brewed in a drip filter,
        considered popular in the United States of America.
        This drink consists of a single or double-shot of espresso combined with up to four or five ounces of hot water in a two-demitasse cup.
        It is important to note, that an Americano is created by adding the water to an already extracted espresso,
        not by extracting extra water through a single espresso puck.
        An Americano can be produced from lighter roasted coffees and roasts not generally associated with espresso, such as Ethiopian or Sumatran origins.
        While some state that the Americano was created in Europe to deride the perceived American taste for weaker coffees,
        it is more likely that it was developed in the United States city of Seattle.
        A well-made Americano retains the subtle aroma of espresso with a lighter body and less bitterness.
